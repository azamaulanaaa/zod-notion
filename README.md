## Project Overview

**zod-notion** is a Deno-based project that provides complete Zod schema types for the Notion REST API. These schemas are built to provide type safety when interacting with Notion’s API, helping developers avoid potential issues and enhancing the development experience. It is a tool built out of necessity, as no similar solution exists for Deno and Notion users.

- **Core functionality**: Full type safety for the Notion API using Zod schemas.
- **Target audience**: Developers using Deno and needing type-safe interactions with Notion.
- **Tech stack**: Built for Deno, uses Zod for schema validation.
